# Privacy Policy for Photo Freshr

**Last updated: December 18, 2025**

## The Short Version

**Photo Freshr collects no data. Period.**

Your photos and decisions stay on your device. We have no servers, no analytics, no tracking, and no way to access your information.

## What This App Does

Photo Freshr helps you organize your photo library by letting you review and categorize your photos. Here's exactly what happens:

### Photos You Review
- The app accesses your device's photo library **only with your explicit permission**
- Photos are read **locally on your device** — they are never uploaded anywhere
- Your keep/archive decisions are stored **locally on your device** using on-device storage
- When you close or delete the app, all decision data is removed with it

### What We Do NOT Do
- ❌ We do **not** collect any personal data
- ❌ We do **not** have servers or a backend
- ❌ We do **not** use analytics or tracking
- ❌ We do **not** collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or usage data
- ❌ We do **not** share any information with third parties
- ❌ We do **not** use advertising or ad networks
- ❌ We do **not** require an account or login
- ❌ We do **not** make any network connections

## Permissions

### Photo Library Access
- **Why we need it**: To display your photos for review and organization
- **How we use it**: Read-only access to show photos; write access only if you choose to delete/archive photos
- **How to control it**: You can enable or disable photo access anytime in your device's Settings → Privacy → Photos

---

## Data Storage

All app data is stored **locally on your device only**:
- Your photo organization decisions (keep/archive) are stored in local on-device storage
- This data never leaves your device
- Uninstalling the app removes all stored data

---

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store any of your data on external servers:

- **There's nothing to request** — we have no data about you
- **There's nothing to delete** — just uninstall the app to remove all local data
- **There's nothing to export** — your decisions are already on your device (and you can export them as JSON within the app)

### For California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)
We do not collect, sell, or share personal information. The CCPA/CPRA rights to know, delete, correct, and opt-out do not apply because we have no personal information to act upon.

### For European Residents (GDPR)
We do not process personal data. Since no data is collected or transmitted, GDPR data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability, etc.) are not applicable. Your photos remain entirely under your control on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 (or 16 in the EU). Since we collect no data, there is no children's data to protect.

---

## Third-Party Services

Photo Freshr uses **no third-party services**:
- No analytics (no Firebase, no Crashlytics, no Mixpanel)
- No advertising networks
- No cloud storage
- No external APIs

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version here and update the "Last updated" date. Since we don't collect your email or any contact information, we cannot notify you directly — please check back periodically.
