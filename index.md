# Privacy Policy

**Photo Freshr**  
Last updated: December 18, 2025

## We don't collect your data

Photo Freshr is built to work entirely on your device. We don't have servers, we don't run analytics, and we have no way to see your photos or how you use the app.

When you review and organize your photos, everything happens locally. Your decisions are saved on your phone, not in the cloud.

## What the app accesses

**Your photo library** — With your permission, Photo Freshr reads photos from your device so you can review them. Photos are never uploaded or transmitted anywhere.

**Local storage** — The app saves your keep/archive decisions to your device. This data stays on your phone and is deleted when you uninstall the app.

That's it. No accounts, no tracking, no network requests.

## What we don't do

We don't collect personal information. We don't track usage patterns. We don't use third-party analytics like Firebase or Crashlytics. We don't serve ads. We don't share anything with anyone because there's nothing to share.

## Your privacy rights

**For California residents**: Under the CCPA, you have the right to know what personal information a business collects and to request its deletion. Since Photo Freshr doesn't collect personal information, these rights don't apply in practice — but you're welcome to contact us with any questions.

**For European residents**: Under the GDPR, you have rights regarding your personal data including access, correction, and deletion. Since we don't collect or process personal data, these rights aren't applicable — your photos never leave your device and we have no record of you.

---

## Children

We don't collect information from anyone, including children. There's nothing to protect because nothing is gathered.

---

## Changes

If this policy changes, we'll update it here and note the date. Since we don't have your contact information, we can't notify you directly.
